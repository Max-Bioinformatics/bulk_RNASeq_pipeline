# bulk_RNASeq_pipeline  

This repository contains a generalized, base-level pipeline/tutorial for analyzing high-throughput bulk RNA-sequencing data. Each step in the process, from the initial data acquisition and quality-control to the production of images for presentation or publication, has its own folder that contains the instructions and program scripts required to proceed to the next step. Below is a brief description of each step:  

## 1. Initial Quality Control  



## 2. Genome & Annotations  



## 3. Read-Alignment & Gene-Counts  



## 4. Investigate & Visualize Data   



## 5. Analysis of Differential Gene Expression  



## 6. Creating Informative Images  



## 7. Preparing for Publication
